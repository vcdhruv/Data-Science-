    "Statistics is broadly divided into two main types: Descriptive Statistics and Inferential Statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "Definition: Descriptive statistics summarize and describe the features of a dataset. They provide simple summaries about the data, such as measures of central tendency (like mean, median, mode) and measures of variability (like range, variance, standard deviation).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Imagine you have test scores from a class of students. Descriptive statistics can be used to calculate the average score, the highest and lowest scores, and the most common score.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it's used: Descriptive statistics are used when you want to get a quick understanding of your data without making any predictions or generalizations. For instance, a teacher might use descriptive statistics to summarize the test scores of their class to see how the class performed overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inferential Statistics\n",
    "Definition: Inferential statistics go beyond simply describing the data. They involve making predictions or inferences about a larger population based on a sample of data. This type often uses probability theory to make estimates, test hypotheses, or predict future outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Suppose a company wants to know how satisfied their customers are, but they can't survey every customer. They might survey a random sample of customers and use inferential statistics to infer the overall customer satisfaction level for all their customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it's used: Inferential statistics are used when you want to draw conclusions about a population based on a sample. For example, in election polling, a sample of voters is surveyed, and inferential statistics are used to predict how the entire population will vote."

    "Qualitative data represent categories or qualities that describe non-numeric characteristics. They can be further divided into:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Nominal Data\n",
    "Definition: Nominal data are categories that don't have a specific order. Each category is distinct and doesn't imply any ranking.\n",

    "2. Quantitative (Numerical) Data\n",
    "Quantitative data represent numeric values and can be measured. They can be further divided into:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Discrete Data\n",
    "Definition: Discrete data consist of distinct, separate values that can be counted. They are often whole numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: The number of cars in a parking lot is discrete data because you can count them (e.g., 1 car, 2 cars, etc.), and you can't have a fraction of a car.\n",

    "\n",

    "Example: Educational level (High school, Bachelor's, Master's, PhD) is an ordinal variable. There is a clear order, but the difference in educational attainment between each level is not precisely quantifiable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Interval Level\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: The interval level of measurement involves ordered data with consistent intervals between values. However, it lacks a true zero point, meaning that ratios are not meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Temperature measured in degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit is an interval variable. The difference between 20°C and 30°C is the same as between 30°C and 40°C, but 0°C does not mean \"no temperature.\"\n",

    "Definition: The ratio level of measurement has all the properties of the interval level, but it also includes a true zero point, allowing for the calculation of ratios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Weight is a ratio variable. It has a true zero (0 kg means no weight), and the ratio of two values is meaningful (e.g., 20 kg is twice as heavy as 10 kg)."

    "\n",
    "Incorrect Analysis: If the researcher mistakenly treats this ordinal data as interval data and calculates the mean satisfaction score, the result could be misleading. For instance, averaging \"Very Satisfied\" (assigned a value of 5) and \"Neutral\" (assigned a value of 3) to get a score of 4 (\"Satisfied\") is incorrect because the distance between \"Neutral\" and \"Satisfied\" isn't necessarily the same as between \"Satisfied\" and \"Very Satisfied.\""
