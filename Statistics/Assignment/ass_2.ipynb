    "#### Average (Mean):\n",
    "\n",
    "    Both Class A and Class B have the same mean score of 72.0. This indicates that, on average, students in both classes scored the same. However, this doesn't tell us anything about how the scores are distributed around this mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Range:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Class A: The range is 8 (from 68 to 76), meaning that the scores are tightly clustered around the mean.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Class B: The range is 45 (from 50 to 95), which indicates a much broader spread of scores. This suggests that while the average is the same, individual scores in Class B vary much more widely.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variance:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Class A: The variance is 8.0, which is relatively low, indicating that the scores in Class A are close to the mean.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Class B: The variance is 306.0, which is much higher, showing that the scores in Class B are spread out further from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Standard Deviation:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Class A: The standard deviation is 2.83, a low value that confirms the scores are close to the mean.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Class B: The standard deviation is 17.49, a high value that suggests there is a lot of variability in the scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interpretation:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Class A: The low range, variance, and standard deviation indicate that students' scores are relatively consistent, clustering closely around the mean of 72. This suggests a more uniform performance among students in Class A.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Class B: The high range, variance, and standard deviation indicate a much more varied performance among students. While the average score is the same as Class A, some students scored much higher or much lower, leading to a broader spread of scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Class A has more consistent performance with scores close to the mean, while Class B has more variability, with scores widely dispersed around the mean. This suggests that while the average performance is the same, the level of consistency in Class A is much higher compared to Class B."

    "Outliers are data points that differ significantly from other observations in a dataset. They can have a substantial impact on both measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and measures of dispersion (range, variance, standard deviation).\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean : Outliers can heavily influence the mean because the mean is calculated by summing all data points and dividing by the number of points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median : The median is less affected by outliers because it represents the middle value of a sorted dataset. The median remains stable even if extreme values are present, as long as the dataset is sufficiently large.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode : Outliers generally have little impact on the mode unless they are extremely frequent. The mode is the most common value in the dataset, so a single extreme value doesn’t affect it unless it appears frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Range : The range is directly affected by outliers because it is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum values. Outliers can inflate the range, making it larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance & Std : Both variance and standard deviation are affected by outliers because they involve the squared differences from the mean. Outliers increase these squared differences, leading to higher variance and standard deviation."
